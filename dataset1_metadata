But Xeno canto seem to call it invalid name. Here is the link to Avocet data base http://www.avocet.zoology.msu.edu/recordings/440. At least four birds were singing in the vicinity. Only in a couple of places sound of wind has been reduced or otherwise it is pretty much as recorded. Amazingly tiny birds with loudest sound and longest of calls. In different locations the first phrase seem to be different by locations. I recorded the same species in Tsuruoka region it sounded different and was also different in Lake Tawadoko region.  I will upload those when I work on them and give link to this piece.  Birds were either on the top of a tree or could be somewhere in the middle of the tree on am exposed branch.

"195626","Bubo","virginianus","Great Horned Owl","Lance A. M. Benner","United States","Three Points, Angeles National Forest, Los Angeles County, California","""Wac wac"" call in response to playing a northern saw-whet owl recording.  A short time after this recording ended, I started hearing female squawk and male territorial calls from the same direction.  I didn't play any great horned owl vocalizations.  This is an uncommon GHOW vocalization, and to identify it, I compared this recording with one on the ""Voices of North American Owls"" CD.  I also compared the recording with spotted owl, long-eared owl, and even mule deer (which I saw nearby) recordings and was able to exclude those species.  A faint western screech owl is audible in the background and earlier I had also heard some whines from a northern saw-whet owl.  Habitat: Edge of an open forest with Coulter pine, canyon live oak, bigcone Douglas Fir, incense cedar, and chaparral  species.  Equipment: Olympus LS-10 with a Telinga 22 inch dish and a Sennheiser ME62 microphone.  Modifications to the file: cropped and amplified by 10 dB.  bird-seen:no  playback-used:yes    [also]  [sono]","call"

The adult female gives the low, nasal bark; the presumed juvenile gives the down-slurred screech. The birds were overhead in a tall narrowleaf cottonwood (Populus angustifolia).  bird-seen:yes  playback-used:no   [sono]","female, juvenile"
