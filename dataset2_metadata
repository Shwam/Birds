Here is the link to Avocet data base http://www.avocet.zoology.msu.edu/recordings/440. At least four birds were singing in the vicinity. Only in a couple of places sound of wind has been reduced or otherwise it is pretty much as recorded. Amazingly tiny birds with loudest sound and longest of calls. In different locations the first phrase seem to be different by locations. I recorded the same species in Tsuruoka region it sounded different and was also different in Lake Tawadoko region.  I will upload those when I work on them and give link to this piece.  Birds were either on the top of a tree or could be somewhere in the middle of the tree on am exposed branch. It took long time for me to see a bird and identify it. I must have heard hundreds of them on Hachimantai mountain.  bird-seen:yes  playback-used:no   Originally a mystery recording . See the forum .
